🔧 Features of the Caesar Cipher GUI 
User-Friendly Interface.

🎨Built using Tkinter, the built-in Python GUI library.

✅Clear layout with input/output fields and buttons for encryption and decryption.


🧪Supports both encrypting (hiding) and decrypting (revealing) messages.

🛡️Keeps non-letter characters (e.g., punctuation, numbers) unchanged.

# ᴄᴜꜱᴛᴏᴍ ꜱʜɪꜰᴛ ᴠᴀʟᴜᴇ:

You can enter any integer shift value (positive or negative) to change how much each letter is rotated in the alphabet.

# ɪᴍᴍᴇᴅɪᴀᴛᴇ ꜰᴇᴇᴅʙᴀᴄᴋ:

Outputs the result directly into the application window without needing to use the command line.

# 🌍 ᴀʙᴏᴜᴛ ᴄᴀᴇꜱᴀʀ ᴄɪᴘʜᴇʀ:

🔑 Great for teaching

🔑 Basic cryptography

🔑 Modular arithmetic

🔑 String manipulation

# 🧠 ᴜꜱᴀɢᴇ:
1. Enter your message in the Input Text field.

2. Enter the Shift Value (e.g., 2).

3. Click Encrypt or Decrypt to view the result.

# ✅ ᴄᴏɴᴄʟᴜꜱɪᴏɴ:
This Caesar Cipher GUI application provides a simple yet effective way to explore classical encryption techniques in a hands-on, visual manner. With its intuitive interface built using Tkinter, it’s ideal for beginners in both Python programming and cryptography.
